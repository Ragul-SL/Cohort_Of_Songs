# Cohort of Songs - Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of songs to extract meaningful insights. Using Python and its rich ecosystem of libraries, the project explores, visualizes, and processes data to uncover trends, patterns, and valuable metrics about songs.

## Features
- **Data Inspection & Exploration**: Comprehensive overview of the dataset, including previews, data types, and summary statistics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Plotting trends and relationships using advanced visualization techniques.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw data into meaningful features for deeper insights.
- **Analysis**: Discovering patterns such as correlations between features and song popularity.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For creating stunning visualizations.
  - `sklearn`: For machine learning and preprocessing.

## Installation and Setup
